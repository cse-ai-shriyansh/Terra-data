# Terra25 Project Proposal

## Executive Summary

**Terra25** is an innovative web application that transforms NASA Terra satellite datasets into compelling animated visualizations, empowering researchers, civic planners, educators, and engaged citizens to understand environmental changes through interactive data storytelling.

## Problem Statement

Environmental data from NASA's Terra satellite mission contains critical insights about our changing planet, but this wealth of information remains largely inaccessible to non-specialists. Current visualization tools are either too technical for general audiences or lack the temporal animation capabilities needed to show environmental changes over time.

## Solution Overview

Terra25 bridges this gap by providing:

- **Intuitive Visualizations**: Transform complex satellite data into understandable visual narratives
- **Temporal Animation**: Show environmental changes over time through smooth, customizable animations
- **Multi-Dataset Integration**: Combine data from all five Terra instruments (MODIS, MOPITT, MISR, ASTER, CERES)
- **Interactive Storytelling**: Enable users to create and share their own data-driven environmental stories
- **Real-time Updates**: Automated ingestion of the latest NASA data for current environmental monitoring

## Data Sources and Methodology

### Primary Data Sources
1. **MODIS**: Fire detection, vegetation health, land cover changes
2. **MOPITT**: Atmospheric carbon monoxide concentrations
3. **MISR**: Aerosol optical depth and air quality indicators
4. **ASTER**: Land surface temperature for urban heat island analysis
5. **CERES**: Earth's radiation budget and energy balance

### Technical Approach
- **Data Ingestion**: Automated Python pipelines connecting to NASA GIBS, LAADS, and GES DISC APIs
- **Processing**: Cloud-based reprojection, compositing, and tile generation using xarray and GDAL
- **Storage**: Efficient storage and delivery via AWS S3 and CloudFront CDN
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps using MapLibre GL with custom NASA tile layers
- **Animation**: Time-series visualization with export capabilities (GIF/MP4)

### Innovation Elements
- **Story Mode**: Guided narratives that walk users through environmental phenomena
- **Comparison Tools**: Side-by-side visualization of different time periods or datasets
- **Custom Region Analysis**: User-defined bounding boxes for localized studies
- **Export Functionality**: Generate publication-ready animations and visualizations

## Impact and Applications

### Environmental Research
- **Fire Dynamics**: Track wildfire progression and assess burn severity over time
- **Air Quality Monitoring**: Visualize pollution patterns and identify emission sources
- **Climate Change Indicators**: Document glacier retreat, vegetation shifts, and temperature anomalies
- **Validation Studies**: Compare satellite observations with ground-based measurements

### Public Policy and Planning
- **Emergency Response**: Real-time monitoring of environmental disasters
- **Urban Planning**: Assess urban heat island effects and plan green infrastructure
- **Public Health**: Correlate environmental conditions with health outcomes
- **Environmental Justice**: Identify communities disproportionately affected by environmental hazards

### Education and Outreach
- **STEM Education**: Engage students with real NASA data and scientific methods
- **Public Awareness**: Communicate climate change impacts through compelling visualizations
- **Data Literacy**: Teach citizens how to interpret and analyze environmental data
- **Advocacy**: Support environmental causes with credible, visualized evidence

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with React and TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with glassmorphism design elements
- **Maps**: MapLibre GL for WebGL-accelerated rendering
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and micro-interactions

### Backend
- **API**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript for data orchestration
- **Processing**: Python services with xarray, rasterio, and GDAL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial metadata
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for processed tiles and animation frames

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **CDN**: CloudFront for global content delivery
- **Monitoring**: Application performance and error tracking
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for processing workloads

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Comprehensive Terra Coverage**: First platform to integrate all five Terra instruments
2. **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive interface designed for non-specialists
3. **Real-time Capabilities**: Automated updates ensure access to the latest data
4. **Story-Driven Approach**: Focus on narrative and impact rather than raw data
5. **Export Functionality**: Generate shareable content for presentations and social media

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Data Coverage**: Ingest and process data from all Terra instruments
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second initial load times, smooth 60fps animations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for data visualization services
- **Scalability**: Support for concurrent users and large datasets

### User Engagement
- **Adoption**: Track user registrations and story creation rates
- **Content Creation**: Number of user-generated environmental stories
- **Educational Impact**: Usage in academic and educational institutions
- **Policy Influence**: Citations in environmental reports and policy documents

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Core Platform
- Basic visualization for MODIS fire and vegetation data
- Interactive map with time-slider controls
- User authentication and story saving capabilities

### Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Multi-Instrument Integration
- Add MOPITT, MISR, ASTER, and CERES datasets
- Implement comparison tools and overlay capabilities
- Launch export functionality for animations

### Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Advanced Features
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- API access for researchers and developers
- Mobile application development
- Integration with social media platforms

## Team and Resources

The Terra25 project leverages expertise in:
- **Satellite Data Processing**: Earth observation and remote sensing
- **Web Development**: Modern frontend and backend technologies
